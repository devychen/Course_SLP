# Neural Networks
## Basics
#### Neural Networks
- Origins lie in biological inspirations from McCulloch-Pitts neuron.
- VS. Logistic Regression:
  - Has very similar maths to LR. And also a <ins>discriminative classifier</ins>.
  - Different in that it <ins>avoids</ins> most uses of rich hand-derived features 
  as in LR, <ins>instead</ins> building NNs that take raw words as inputs 
  and learn to induce features as part of the process of learning to classify.
- The use of modern NNs is often called **deep learning**, deep as <ins>have many layers</ins>.
#### Units
- Modern NNs is a network of small computing units, each of which takes a vector
of input values and produces a single output value.
### XOR
### Neural Networks (NNs)
## Feed Forward NNs
An architecture of NN. Also called **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)**.
## Training NNs
